                    <h1 class="display-4">Who is Daniel A Dickey?</h1>
                    <p>In a wonderful partnership, Daniel is joined in marriage to his amazing wife, Nicole. Together,
                        they share a passion for musicals, kayaking adventures, and savoring culinary experiences.
                        Hailing
                        from Utah, Daniel's early days were marked by a fondness for Legos, technology, and the great
                        outdoors.
                        Following high school, his deep-rooted patriotism and strong yearning to serve motivated him to
                        enlist
                        in the US Army, where he dedicated four years of service, including three combat deployments to
                        Iraq.</p>

                    <p>Fuelled by his love for running and unyielding determination, Daniel achieved an impressive feat
                        that most don't
                        even consider attempting, running a marathon. Completing the Charlotte Marathon on two separate
                        occasions,
                        conquering the demanding 26.2-mile required consistency, self-awareness, discipline, time, and
                        heart.</p>

                    <p>Even amidst a global pandemic, Daniel's unwavering determination propelled him to achieve a
                        significant milestone:
                        he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Utah State University,
                        graduating in 2021.
                        Following his academic success, Daniel embarked on his professional journey as a software
                        engineer at a
                        multinational IT consulting firm. There, he harnesses his profound affinity for technology and
                        natural curiosity
                        to contribute meaningfully to his role. </p>
