        <div class="container">
            <div>
                <h1 class="display-4">Getting to know Daniel</h1>
                <p class="text-justify">As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Stains, Daniel was
                    sealed in marriage,
                    for all time and eternity, to his wonderful wife, Nicole, in the Logan Utah Temple. Nicole and
                    Daniel enjoy attending musicals, walking their two dogs, the occasional kayaking adventure, and
                    trying new culinary experiences together.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Hailing from Utah, Daniel's early days were marked by a fondness for Legos,
                    technology, and the
                    great outdoors. Following high school, his deep-rooted patriotism and strong yearning to serve
                    motivated him to enlist in the US Army, where he dedicated four years of service, including
                    three combat deployments to Iraq.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Fuelled by his love for running and unyielding determination, Daniel achieved an
                    impressive feat
                    that most don't even consider attempting: running a marathon. Completing the Charlotte Marathon
                    on two separate occasions, conquering the demanding 26.2-mile required consistency,
                    self-awareness, discipline, research, time, and heart.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Even amidst a global pandemic, Daniel's unwavering determination propelled him
                    to achieve a
                    significant milestone: he earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Utah State
                    University, graduating in the year of our Lord 2023. Following his academic success, Daniel
                    embarked on his professional journey as a software engineer at a multinational IT consulting
                    firm. There, he harnesses his profound affinity for technology and natural curiosity,
                    contributing meaningfully as he gained real-world experience in software development.</p>
