                    <p class="card-text">This collaborative endeavor embodied the essence of teamwork and software
                        engineering.
                        The team, adeptly guided by the principles of Scrum, embarked on a multifaceted journey
                        encompassing requirement gathering,
                        prototyping, and the creation of crucial artifacts such as use case charts, project plans,
                        activity diagrams,
                        and class diagrams. The project’s objective was to construct an auction website to facilitate
                        fundraising for a local
                        elementary school. <br>

                        The tightly knit team of four collectively shouldered the role of scrum master in turn and
                        stewarding
                        the iterative development process, documented diligently by making use of burndown charts. They
                        integrated daily scrums while harnessing the power of GitHub for streamlined pull requests and
                        issue tracking. Unified by
                        their experience with Django, a collaborative decision was made to leverage the familiar
                        framework. <br>

                        Daniel focused on enhancing the user interface (UI). Armed with HTML, vanilla CSS, and
                        JavaScript, he meticulously transcribed the
                        design gleaned from prototypes into a tangible and engaging UI. Moreover, he contributed his
                        understanding of the controller layer by employing
                        Python, lent his expertise to the creation of the data models and helped with automating the
                        loading of the database with test data during development.</p>

                <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Bee AI</h5>

                    <p class="card-text">Daniel embarked on a short research project of discovery involving labeled
                        data sets of audio. The audio was classified into three categories: ambient sounds,
                        cricket chirping, and bee buzzing. Employing the Python library, TFLearn, Daniel designed
                        a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. He then created and maintained duplicate
                        models using the
                        pickle library. TensorFlow was employed for training, validation, and testing.
                        A random forest (RF) model was constructed and trained using sklearn. <br>

                        Next, Daniel meticulously trained a solitary CNN using the amalgamation of all three datasets.
                        Meanwhile, he undertook training additional CNNs, each one exclusively trained on a single
                        dataset.
                        These three CNNs synergistically formed an ensemble. Using the trained models to create five
                        ensembles, each ensemble utilized a different algorithm for the three CNNs to “vote” on the
                        correct
                        classification of audio clips. Experimenting with the diverse ensemble configurations was an
                        integral phase of his exploration. To enhance the efficiency of the training process, the raw
                        power and parallel processing power of Google Colab's graphics cards were harnessed. <br>

                        A rigorous comparative analysis ensued, pitting the
                        solitary CNN, five ensembles, and the single RF against each other. Accuracy in classifying
                        audio clips was the pivotal criterion for evaluation. Intriguingly, the outcome showcased the
                        solitary CNN as the frontrunner, substantially surpassing all ensembles and the RF. This
                        revelation brought Daniel to the conclusion that sometimes, simpler is better. However, a
                        balance between complexity and simplicity is necessary. After all, the simpler version of CNNs,
                        artificial
                        neural networks, were ruled out early on as they were not up to the task of classifying audio.

                    <h5 class="card-title">Bus Tracking Android App</h5>

                    <p class="card-text">To empower commuters in Daniel’s hometown, he created a native Android
                        application tailored
                        for the Cache Valley Transit District (CVTD) bus system. Aiming to simplify the public transit
                        experience
                        in northern Utah, this mobile app presented an agreeable solution for tracking CVTD buses with
                        precision
                        and timely updates. The mobile app provided a comprehensive and real-time view of bus locations,
                        ensuring
                        users were never out of touch during their commutes. <br>

                        The core of the app's functionality is the retrieval and parsing of XML data sourced from CVTD's
                        API
                        carrying each bus’s latest GPS information. Regular intervals of data synchronization ensured
                        that users
                        received up-to-the-moment positions of all actively running buses. Capitalizing on the robust
                        capabilities
                        of the Mapbox SDK, the app adeptly translated this data into a visual representation fit for
                        consumption. <br>

                        The map came alive with dynamically updated icons, each representing the real-time position of a
                        CVTD bus.
                        Augmenting this map-centric experience, the app leveraged Android OS to display the user’s GPS
                        location,
                        further enhancing their ability to commute with less stress. Embracing a sustainable
                        monetization strategy,
                        the bus tracker featured banner ads integrated via Google Mobile Ads, ensuring the option for
                        long-term
                        sustained app development and improvement.</p>
