    <tr>
        <td>Agile</td>
        <td>Agile is an idea or philosophy. In software development, agile practices involve discovering requirements
            and developing solutions through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and
            their customer/end user.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Scrum</td>
        <td>The most popular agile framework, with 66 percent of all agile frameworks being scrum or scrum
            variants. Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an
            initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research,
            sales, marketing and advanced technologies.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Project Manager</td>
        <td>Part of the scrumframework which manages the budget and the risks of the project. Focuses on processes and
            allocates tasks to
            the team members.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Scrum Master</td>
        <td>The team role responsible for ensuring the team lives agile values and principles and follows the processes
            and practices that the team agreed they would use.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Scrum Development Team</td>
        <td>Four to eight team members who are cross-trained, have technical skills, are self-organized. Each team
            member picks tasks to complete during the sprint.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Sprint</td>
        <td>A 2-4 week period when a team works on a product without making changes to the requirements. They break up
            the tasks into smaller sub-tasks, and team members volunteer to take on as many sub-tasks as they think they
            can complete in the given time frame.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Kanban</td>
        <td>A two-bin system where employees track stock by taking a card out when inventory is running low.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>DevOps</td>
        <td>The combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s
            ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products faster than
            organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed
            enables organizations to serve their customers better and compete more effectively in the market.
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Agile project management</td>
        <td>An iterative approach to delivering a project throughout its life cycle.
            Iterative methods are frequently used in software development projects to promote velocity and adaptability
            since the benefit of iteration is that you can adjust as you go along rather than following a linear path.
        </td>
    </tr>


    <tr>
        <td>Iterative Process</td>
        <td>Changing the plan as the project develops differently than initially planned. It is repeating planning,
            doing, testing, reviewing until you get a product that satisfies the customers’ needs.
        </td>
    </tr>


    <tr>
        <td>C-Suite</td>
        <td>The group of executives for a company or the people who make the most important decisions and hold the most
            influence on how things are done
        </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Extreme Programming</td>
        <td>An agile software development framework that aims to produce higher quality software and higher quality of
            life for the development team. By reducing the turnaround on products, reduces the price and, therefore, can
            create higher-quality software.
